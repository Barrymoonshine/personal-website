            <p> Hey, I’m Nick — welcome to my corner of the internet. </p>
            <p>
                I’m a backend-focused Software Engineer based in Bristol, UK. Before moving into engineering, I worked as a Product Manager, which left me with a lasting interest in how technology can solve real-world problems while balancing customer needs, business goals and the inevitable trade-offs that come with both. </p>
            <p>
                Most of my experience sits on the backend, working with TypeScript (Node.js) and C# (ASP.NET). I also hold AWS and MongoDB certifications. On the front-end side, I’ve mainly worked with React and Next.js, typically using TypeScript across the stack.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of work, you’ll usually find me in the gym, at the piano, digging through crates for new vinyl, or spending time with my family — including my cat, Mr Sprinkles.
